# Miuulib - Book Recommandation system

A project that makes a content-based book recommendation when you enter the last book you read, gives the content of the book, offers the link where you can buy this book, and gives a youtube video containing the book review. TF-IDF and Cosine-Similarity algorithms have been used for this project.

## Dataset

This is a dataset was created as a personal project to learn scraping and to provide a usable and extensive dataset to the community. It scrapes the books from goodreads website. It contains 100.000 rows.

## Streamlit

We decided to present it to users with an interface using Streamlit. In the app.py we created, we called functions that predict books in Streamlit. We wanted to change the background image specific to each weather condition. We published the site we created on Streamlit.
